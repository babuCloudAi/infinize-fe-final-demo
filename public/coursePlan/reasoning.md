**Reasoning Behind Jane Smith’s Academic Plan**

In creating Jane Smith’s academic plan toward graduation, we considered several key assumptions and constraints to ensure she stays on track for her degree. Here’s how we approached the planning process:

---

### **A. Overall Planning Assumptions**

1. **Graduation Goal**: Jane needs to reach **120 total credits** by **Fall 2026** to graduate on time.
2. **Credits Completed So Far**: Jane currently has **62 completed credits** and is enrolled in **15 more credits** this Spring 2025, totaling **77 credits**. This means she needs **43 additional credits** to meet the graduation requirement.
3. **Full-Time Status**: Jane must maintain **full-time enrollment (minimum 12 credits per term)** to retain her scholarship. We aim for **"normal" loads of 12 credits per term**, balancing her workload.
4. **Course Sequence and Major Requirements**: All **Criminal Justice (CJ) core courses and electives**, including required **upper-division law**, **stratification**, and **CJ electives**, must be completed in proper sequence.
5. **Course Availability and Career Fit**: We selected courses based on **known scheduling patterns** and offerings, focusing on **Criminal Justice** and **complementary general education (GE)** electives aligned with her **career interest in Cybersecurity**.

### **B. Review of Jane's Progress to Date**

Jane’s **Spring 2025 (in-progress)** schedule includes **15 credits**, with a thoughtful mix of major requirements and general education courses:

-   **ENGL 342L** (3 cr): English Composition II (online)
-   **CRJS 125** (3 cr): The Criminal Justice System (TRAD, T/Th 11:00–12:15)
-   **SOC 354** (2 cr): Introduction to Sociology (online, M/W/F 14:00–14:50)
-   **CRJS 105** (2 cr): Corrections & Society (TRAD, M/W 15:30–16:45)
-   **CRJS 123** (2 cr): Introduction to Criminology (TRAD, T/Th 15:30–16:45)
-   **CRJS 287** (3 cr): Law Enforcement & Society (TRAD, T/Th 13:30–14:45)

These courses advance her **Criminal Justice foundations** and fulfill part of her **English Composition** GE requirement.

Jane's **Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice** requires the following:

#### **1. Core (Foundation) Courses (3 credits each)**

-   CRJS 215S (Completed Fall 2024)
-   CRJS 222 (Enrolled Spring 2025)

### **D. Term-by-Term Strategy for Remaining Credits**

To efficiently distribute her **remaining 43 credits**, we spread them across **Summer 2025, Fall 2025, Spring 2026, and Fall 2026**, aiming for **12 credits per term** to maintain full-time status. Here's how we approached it:

1. **Prerequisite Awareness**: We carefully sequenced courses, ensuring prerequisites (like CRJS 222 before CRJS 262) are met on time.
2. **Balanced Workload**: A mix of CJ core courses, electives, and GE as needed to avoid overloading any single term.
3. **Course Availability**: Courses are selected from **known or typical semester offerings**, fitting within **Jane's preferred schedule times (mid-morning to early afternoon)**.
4. **Final Wrap-Up**: In **Fall 2026**, we ensure all CJ requirements are met. To **bring her to 120 credits**, **Fall 2026** may include free electives (if needed), allowing flexibility for any last-minute adjustments.

### **E. Final Outcome by Fall 2026**

By following this plan, **Jane will have completed**:

✅ All **CJ foundation courses**  
✅ One **stratification course (SOC 320)**  
✅ One **upper-level law course (CRJS 320)**  
✅ At least **18 credits in CJ electives**  
✅ A **capstone project (CRJS 436)** to synthesize her learning  
✅ Enough **total credits (120)** for graduation

---

### **F. Additional Notes**

-   We assume that **other GE requirements (e.g., Math, Oral Comm, Information Literacy)** are either already satisfied via past courses or transfer credits.
-   A **heavier Fall 2026 term** is built into the contingency to ensure credit completion if something shifts.
-   Elective selections later may be tailored to **Cybersecurity-related topics**, if available within CJ or interdisciplinary courses.
